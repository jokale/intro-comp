# Intro component with sign-up form
This is the fifth project out of a series in the [16 Frontend Projects](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl) by Matt Studdert. 
The aim of this project is to ensure that users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
   - Any input field is empty
   - The email address is not formatted correctly


Once built it will be deployed utilising Vercel.

###### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
